## Introduction
_Mailr_ is a IMAP mail client based on _Ruby on Rails_ platform.

**NOTE** All path and filenames are based on _Rails.root_ directory.

### Requirements

In _Rails 3_ all dependencies should be defined in file _Gemfile_. All needed gems can be installed using bundler.

### Installation procedure

* Checkout the source code.

* Install all dependiences. Check if proper gems (sqlite3/mysql/postgresql) are defined in _Gemfile_ and installed. Use _bundler_ for that:

```shell
bundle install
```

* Check _config/defaults.yml_ for proper values.

* Prepare config/database.yml file (see _config/database.yml.example_).

* Migrate database (rake db:migrate)

* Start rails server if applicable

* Point your browser to application URL:
  For local access: http://localhost:3000
  For remote access: http://some_url/mailr

```shell
rake db:clear_data
```
